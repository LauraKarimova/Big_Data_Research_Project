The 3D bin packing problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves fitting a given set of items of various sizes into a container of a specific size such that the total volume of the items is as close to the volume of the container as possible.


The objective of this work is to develop an algorithm using model-free reinforcement learning, specifically Q-learning, to solve the 3D bin packing problem. The algorithm will be designed to maximize the volume utilization of the containers while taking into account constraints such as size limits, and handling irregularly shaped items and dynamic changes in the number of items and containers. The performance of the algorithm will be evaluated using different scenarios and compared with other existing approaches.
